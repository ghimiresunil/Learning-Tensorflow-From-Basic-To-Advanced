### ðŸ›  00. TensorFlow Fundamentals Exercises

1. Create a vector, scalar, matrix and tensor with values of your choosing using `tf.constant()`.
2. Find the shape, rank and size of the tensors you created in 1.
3. Create two tensors containing random values between 0 and 1 with shape `[5, 300]`.
4. Multiply the two tensors you created in 3 using matrix multiplication.
5. Multiply the two tensors you created in 3 using dot product.
6. Create a tensor with random values between 0 and 1 with shape `[224, 224, 3]`.
7. Find the min and max values of the tensor you created in 6 along the first axis.
8. Created a tensor with random values of shape `[1, 224, 224, 3]` then squeeze it to change the shape to `[224, 224, 3]`.
9. Create a tensor with shape `[10]` using your own choice of values, then find the index which has the maximum value.
10. One-hot encode the tensor you created in 9.
